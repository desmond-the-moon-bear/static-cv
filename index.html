                <p>
                    Aspiring programmer with a passion for learning and tackling grand
                    projects beyond my current skill level. My goal is to become a game
                    programmer and help further the development of the industry. I have
                    created a couple of short demo games and a graduation project.

                        Game projects I have created in different levels of completion.
                        Include the graduation project from my high school - "Hexdefence".
                        During this project I gained experience in the usage of an integrated
                        database and a design technique for the Unity game engine.

                        I am the creator of the bear esoteric language. It is a two-dimensional
                        language in which you do not really write programs but obstacle courses
                        for unlucky bears which are coerced to do stuff when they enter certain cells.

                        As a hobby and a way to stay sharp I infrequently participate
                        in online programming competitions. Such competitions require
                        creative and algorithmic thinking in addition to performing
                        under pressure.
